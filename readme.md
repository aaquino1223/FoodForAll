# FoodForAll

Web project meant for a database course.

The goal was to create a product with social media features. In this case, it was an app that would allow food based companies (restuarants, super markets) to post that they have food that they would have otherwise thrown out. For example, super markets often throw out vegetable and fruits that don't look the best despite being perfectly fine to consume. Organizations that distribute food to those in need, such as churches or homeless shelters, would be able to see these posts and indicate that they would pick it up. The long-term of this product would have been to reduce food waste.
